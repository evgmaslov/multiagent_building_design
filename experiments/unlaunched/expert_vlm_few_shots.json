[{"image_path": "few_shot_images/cor1.png", "review": "The image shows a kitchen and a bathroom. They intersect because the lower left corner of the bathroom is inside the kitchen. To avoid them intersecting, you need to move the bathroom up or to the left, or move the kitchen down or to the right."}, {"image_path": "few_shot_images/cor2.png", "review": "The image shows two rooms - a living room and a bedroom. At first glance, they do not intersect because the upper wall of the bedroom and the lower wall of the living room are at a distance from each other. But if you look closely, you can see that there are vertical walls between the rooms. This means that in fact, the upper wall of the bathroom lies inside the living room, and the lower wall of the living room lies inside the bathroom. This means that the living room and bathroom intersect. The intersection can be corrected by moving the bathroom down or moving the living room up."}, {"image_path": "few_shot_images/cor3.png", "review": "The picture shows a hallway, a bathroom and a wardrobe. The zones of the rooms are marked with pink, yellow and orange colors.\nThere is a white rectangle between the hallway and the bathroom. You can see that if this white rectangle is included in the area of the bathroom, it will become a perfect rectangle. This means that this white rectangle is the intersection of the hallway and the bathroom.\nThere is also a white rectangle between the hallway and the wardrobe. By analogy with the bathroom, you can see that this white rectangle is the intersection of the hallway and the wardrobe.\nThere is also a white rectangle between the wardrobe and the bathroom. We can see that their right walls coincide. This means that the white rectangle is the intersection of the wardrobe and the bathroom.\nThus, in the picture, the hallway intersects with the bathroom, the hallway intersects with the wardrobe and the wardrobe intersects with the bathroom.\nTo fix the intersections, you can move the hallway to the left. Then the hallway will no longer intersect with the wardrobe and the bathroom. To fix the intersection between the wardrobe and the bathroom, you can move the wardrobe up or the bathroom down."}]
