{"input": "Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway. The bathroom should be combined and adjoin the hallway. From the hallway there should be exits to the bedroom and kitchen. From the kitchen there should be an exit to the loggia.", "actions": "1. Design the hallway. The hallway is the first space that is usually encountered upon entering the apartment, so it should be placed at the entrance. Given that the apartment has a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway, the hallway should be large enough to accommodate both the wardrobe and a space for movement. Make the hallway rectangular with dimensions of 2.2 m by 3.2 m, which provides enough space for a wardrobe and movement.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. According to the requirements, the bathroom should be combined and adjoin the hallway. This will allow for easy access from the bedroom and kitchen. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions of 2.2 m by 1.6 m, which provides enough space for a shower, toilet, and sink.\n3. Design the bedroom. According to the requirements, the bedroom should be a separate room with its own entrance from the hallway. Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.2 m by 4.2 m, which provides enough space for a queen-sized bed and dressers.\n4. Add a separate wardrobe. Since the hallway is combined with the wardrobe, make the wardrobe rectangular with dimensions of 2.2 m by 1.2 m, which provides enough space for hanging clothes and shelves. The wardrobe should be placed in the hallway adjacent to the bedroom entrance.\n5. Design the kitchen. The kitchen should be located near the bathroom and loggia, as this will allow for easy access to both. Make the kitchen rectangular with dimensions of 2.2 m by 2.6 m, which provides enough space for a stove, refrigerator, sink, and cabinets.\n6. Add an exit to the loggia. The loggia should be accessible from the kitchen, as this is a common layout in apartment design. Make a door in the kitchen leading to the loggia.\n7. Ensure functional connections. According to the requirements, the rooms should be functionally connected. This means that there should be a clear path of movement between the rooms. Make sure that there are no obstacles in the hallway that would prevent easy movement between the rooms.\n8. Check the apartment layout. Once all the rooms have been designed, check the overall layout to ensure that it meets all the requirements. The apartment should have a separate bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, wardrobe, and loggia, all connected by a functional hallway. The dimensions of each room should be sufficient to meet the needs of the occupants.", "code": "\nRoom hallway = new Room(\n    name: \"Hallway\",\n    contourPoints: new List<Vector2> {\n        new Vector2(0, 0),\n        new Vector2(0, 3200),\n        new Vector2(2200, 3200),\n        new Vector2(2200, 0)\n    }\n);\n"}
