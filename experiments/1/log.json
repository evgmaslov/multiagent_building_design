You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a studio apartment.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a studio apartment with a large kitchen area of \\u200b\\u200bat least 6 m2.

Place the hallway: Since the requirement is to have a large hallway, make it a significant portion of the apartment's total area. Designate an area of approximately 3.2 m by 2 m, making the hallway rectangular. Place the hallway at the entrance to the apartment, and locate the front door in the hallway.\n2. Place the combined bathroom: According to the codes, the bathroom can share space with the toilet. Make the combined bathroom adjacent to the hallway to allow easy access. Since the codes require a minimum of 6 m2 for the kitchen, and assuming a standard 1.6 m width for the hallway, make the bathroom approximately 2 m deep, which will allow for a compact yet functional space.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area: Since there should be no wall between the living room and kitchen, make them one continuous space. Given the requirement for a kitchen area of at least 6 m2 and the hallway width of 1.6 m, the resulting common space (kitchen and living room) should be approximately 4.4 m by 6 m, with the kitchen occupying the area closest to the bathroom. This configuration ensures compliance with code requirements and allows for a spacious combined living and kitchen area.\n4. Verify the plan: Confirm that the design adheres to the apartment's size requirements and that the living room, kitchen, hallway, and combined bathroom are all properly connected. Ensure that the design provides a 14 m2 (minimum) living area, taking into account the combined living and kitchen space and the hallway. If necessary, adjust the layout to meet these requirements.\n\nThe justification for this sequence is based on the efficient use of space while addressing all the specified requirements. The large hallway provides easy access to all rooms, while the combined bathroom saves space compared to having separate rooms for each function.

Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a one-room apartment, more than 30 m2.

Place the combined bathroom: Decide on the location of the combined bathroom. Consider the convenience and ease of access, place the bathroom next to the hallway. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions of 1.85 m by 1.61 m, which is a compact size while still providing enough space for a bathtub, toilet, and sink.\n\n4. Design the kitchen: According to the state code, the kitchen's minimum area should be 8 m2 for social usage. However, given that this is a one-room apartment and the total area is more than 30 m2, aim for a larger kitchen. Make the kitchen rectangular with dimensions around 3 m by 3 m (9 m2). Place it next to the hallway and combine it with the living area. The combined living room and kitchen will provide enough space for relaxation and cooking.\n\n5. Design the bedroom: Decide on the location of the bedroom. Place the bedroom adjacent to the kitchen area for easy access and an efficient layout. Based on the requirement for a minimum area of 10 m2 for a bedroom for two people, make the bedroom rectangular in plan with dimensions of 3 m by 3.33 m (10 m2). This will provide a comfortable space for the bed and other necessary furniture.\n\n6. Determine the connections between rooms: Make sure there is a door from the hallway to the bathroom, a doorway between the kitchen and the hallway, and a doorway between the kitchen and the bedroom. This will ensure easy access and functional connections between the rooms.\n\nThe sequence of actions taken is based on prioritizing functionality and convenience.

Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink.

According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway.

Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be below the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a loggia exit. The loggia should be accessible from the kitchen, so make a door from the kitchen to the loggia. The loggia can have a small area, for example, 2 by 3 m.\n\nI chose this sequence of actions because it is important to start designing an apartment from the hallway, since it is the first room that residents and guests see when they enter the apartment. Then it is necessary to place the bathroom and bedroom, taking into account their minimum sizes. The kitchen should be placed next to the hallway, removing the wall between them to create a functional and spacious living space. Finally, it is necessary to make an exit from the kitchen to the loggia.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide.

Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area.
