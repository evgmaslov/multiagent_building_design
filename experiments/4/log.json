You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."

The drawing is created using C# code.\n You receive the current state of the code that creates the apartment plan as input, in the form of the DesignFlat() method.Finally, you receive instructions on what to add to the code.Change the code based on the instructions and display the changes in the output format of the git diff command. Here is a short description of the output format: \n    The git diff command shows the code changes between two versions of code.\n    Git normally shows a chunk of lines that has been modified, not the entire file. Every chunk starts with a Chunk header. The chunk header will be identified by @@ (at the start and end). Then, there are two sets of numbers. For example, if the sets look like -3,4 +3,2, then -3,4 means from old version of code, extracting four lines starting from line 3, and +3,2 means from new version of code, extracting two lines starting from line 3.\n    Then come the modified lines, where the line starting with (-) should be removed from the old code, and the line starting with the (+) should be added to the new code.\n    Here are detailed instructions on how to describe changes in code in git diff format:\n    To specify what needs to be changed in the code, you first need to specify which line of code the changes begin at. You also need to specify how many rows to remove and how many rows to add. This is specified in chunk header format, which looks like this: @@ -START_INDEX,NUM_REMOVED_ROWS +START_INDEX,NUM_ADDED_ROWS @@. In this format, START_INDEX is the number of the line starting from which lines of code must be removed. NUM_REMOVED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be removed from the code starting with line number START_INDEX. And NUM_ADDED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be inserted into the code starting with lines with the number START_INDEX.\n    Here are some examples of how to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines removed and added using the chunk header format. For example, if you need to delete 1 line starting from line 6 and add 2 lines, you need to write @@ -6,1 +6,2 @@. If you need to delete 2 lines starting from line 13 and add 1 line, you need to write @@ -13,2 +13,1 @@.\n    After the chunk header you need to write which lines to remove and which to add. To write which lines need to be deleted, you need to write those lines by adding a \"-\" sign in front of them. To indicate which lines need to be inserted in place of the deleted ones, you need to write the added lines with a \"+\" sign at the beginning. There is no need to write lines that remain unchanged. Accordingly, you need to write only lines with the “-” or “+” sign.\n    Thus, to indicate what changes need to be made to the code, you need to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines to remove and add in the chunk header format, and also write the lines that need to be removed with a \"-\" sign and the lines that need to be added, with a \"+\" sign.\n You are required to make an additional corridor if you need to connect rooms that are not adjacent.Change the position of the already created rooms so that the rooms do not intersect.\n Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nCode state:\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Flat flat = new Flat(new List<Room> { });\n    return flat;\n}\n```\nCurrent instruction: \"Place the hallway.

Here is a short description of the output format: \n    The git diff command shows the code changes between two versions of code.\n    Git normally shows a chunk of lines that has been modified, not the entire file. Every chunk starts with a Chunk header. The chunk header will be identified by @@ (at the start and end). Then, there are two sets of numbers. For example, if the sets look like -3,4 +3,2, then -3,4 means from old version of code, extracting four lines starting from line 3, and +3,2 means from new version of code, extracting two lines starting from line 3.\n    Then come the modified lines, where the line starting with (-) should be removed from the old code, and the line starting with the (+) should be added to the new code.\n    Here are detailed instructions on how to describe changes in code in git diff format:\n    To specify what needs to be changed in the code, you first need to specify which line of code the changes begin at. You also need to specify how many rows to remove and how many rows to add. This is specified in chunk header format, which looks like this: @@ -START_INDEX,NUM_REMOVED_ROWS +START_INDEX,NUM_ADDED_ROWS @@. In this format, START_INDEX is the number of the line starting from which lines of code must be removed. NUM_REMOVED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be removed from the code starting with line number START_INDEX. And NUM_ADDED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be inserted into the code starting with lines with the number START_INDEX.\n    Here are some examples of how to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines removed and added using the chunk header format. For example, if you need to delete 1 line starting from line 6 and add 2 lines, you need to write @@ -6,1 +6,2 @@.

Accordingly, you need to write only lines with the “-” or “+” sign.\n    Thus, to indicate what changes need to be made to the code, you need to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines to remove and add in the chunk header format, and also write the lines that need to be removed with a \"-\" sign and the lines that need to be added, with a \"+\" sign.\n You are required to make an additional corridor if you need to connect rooms that are not adjacent.Change the position of the already created rooms so that the rooms do not intersect.\n Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nCode state:\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Flat flat = new Flat(new List<Room> { });\n    return flat;\n}\n```\nCurrent instruction: \"Place the hallway.

Here is a short description of the output format: \n    The git diff command shows the code changes between two versions of code.\n    Git normally shows a chunk of lines that has been modified, not the entire file. Every chunk starts with a Chunk header. The chunk header will be identified by @@ (at the start and end). Then, there are two sets of numbers. For example, if the sets look like -3,4 +3,2, then -3,4 means from old version of code, extracting four lines starting from line 3, and +3,2 means from new version of code, extracting two lines starting from line 3.\n    Then come the modified lines, where the line starting with (-) should be removed from the old code, and the line starting with the (+) should be added to the new code.\n    Here are detailed instructions on how to describe changes in code in git diff format:\n    To specify what needs to be changed in the code, you first need to specify which line of code the changes begin at. You also need to specify how many rows to remove and how many rows to add. This is specified in chunk header format, which looks like this: @@ -START_INDEX,NUM_REMOVED_ROWS +START_INDEX,NUM_ADDED_ROWS @@. In this format, START_INDEX is the number of the line starting from which lines of code must be removed. NUM_REMOVED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be removed from the code starting with line number START_INDEX. And NUM_ADDED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be inserted into the code starting with lines with the number START_INDEX.\n    Here are some examples of how to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines removed and added using the chunk header format. For example, if you need to delete 1 line starting from line 6 and add 2 lines, you need to write @@ -6,1 +6,2 @@.

To indicate which lines need to be inserted in place of the deleted ones, you need to write the added lines with a \"+\" sign at the beginning. There is no need to write lines that remain unchanged. Accordingly, you need to write only lines with the “-” or “+” sign.\n    Thus, to indicate what changes need to be made to the code, you need to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines to remove and add in the chunk header format, and also write the lines that need to be removed with a \"-\" sign and the lines that need to be added, with a \"+\" sign.\n You are required to make an additional corridor if you need to connect rooms that are not adjacent.Change the position of the already created rooms so that the rooms do not intersect.\n Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nCode state:\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Flat flat = new Flat(new List<Room> { });\n    return flat;\n}\n```\nCurrent instruction: \"Place the hallway.

Here is a short description of the output format: \n    The git diff command shows the code changes between two versions of code.\n    Git normally shows a chunk of lines that has been modified, not the entire file. Every chunk starts with a Chunk header. The chunk header will be identified by @@ (at the start and end). Then, there are two sets of numbers. For example, if the sets look like -3,4 +3,2, then -3,4 means from old version of code, extracting four lines starting from line 3, and +3,2 means from new version of code, extracting two lines starting from line 3.\n    Then come the modified lines, where the line starting with (-) should be removed from the old code, and the line starting with the (+) should be added to the new code.\n    Here are detailed instructions on how to describe changes in code in git diff format:\n    To specify what needs to be changed in the code, you first need to specify which line of code the changes begin at. You also need to specify how many rows to remove and how many rows to add. This is specified in chunk header format, which looks like this: @@ -START_INDEX,NUM_REMOVED_ROWS +START_INDEX,NUM_ADDED_ROWS @@. In this format, START_INDEX is the number of the line starting from which lines of code must be removed. NUM_REMOVED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be removed from the code starting with line number START_INDEX. And NUM_ADDED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be inserted into the code starting with lines with the number START_INDEX.\n    Here are some examples of how to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines removed and added using the chunk header format.

Accordingly, you need to write only lines with the “-” or “+” sign.\n    Thus, to indicate what changes need to be made to the code, you need to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines to remove and add in the chunk header format, and also write the lines that need to be removed with a \"-\" sign and the lines that need to be added, with a \"+\" sign.\n You are required to make an additional corridor if you need to connect rooms that are not adjacent.Change the position of the already created rooms so that the rooms do not intersect.\n Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nCode state:\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Flat flat = new Flat(new List<Room> { });\n    return flat;\n}\n```\nCurrent instruction: \"Place the hallway.

Here is a short description of the output format: \n    The git diff command shows the code changes between two versions of code.\n    Git normally shows a chunk of lines that has been modified, not the entire file. Every chunk starts with a Chunk header. The chunk header will be identified by @@ (at the start and end). Then, there are two sets of numbers. For example, if the sets look like -3,4 +3,2, then -3,4 means from old version of code, extracting four lines starting from line 3, and +3,2 means from new version of code, extracting two lines starting from line 3.\n    Then come the modified lines, where the line starting with (-) should be removed from the old code, and the line starting with the (+) should be added to the new code.\n    Here are detailed instructions on how to describe changes in code in git diff format:\n    To specify what needs to be changed in the code, you first need to specify which line of code the changes begin at. You also need to specify how many rows to remove and how many rows to add. This is specified in chunk header format, which looks like this: @@ -START_INDEX,NUM_REMOVED_ROWS +START_INDEX,NUM_ADDED_ROWS @@. In this format, START_INDEX is the number of the line starting from which lines of code must be removed. NUM_REMOVED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be removed from the code starting with line number START_INDEX. And NUM_ADDED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be inserted into the code starting with lines with the number START_INDEX.\n    Here are some examples of how to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines removed and added using the chunk header format. For example, if you need to delete 1 line starting from line 6 and add 2 lines, you need to write @@ -6,1 +6,2 @@.

To indicate which lines need to be inserted in place of the deleted ones, you need to write the added lines with a \"+\" sign at the beginning. There is no need to write lines that remain unchanged. Accordingly, you need to write only lines with the “-” or “+” sign.\n    Thus, to indicate what changes need to be made to the code, you need to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines to remove and add in the chunk header format, and also write the lines that need to be removed with a \"-\" sign and the lines that need to be added, with a \"+\" sign.\n You are required to make an additional corridor if you need to connect rooms that are not adjacent.Change the position of the already created rooms so that the rooms do not intersect.\n Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nCode state:\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Flat flat = new Flat(new List<Room> { });\n    return flat;\n}\n```\nCurrent instruction: \"Place the hallway.

Here is a short description of the output format: \n    The git diff command shows the code changes between two versions of code.\n    Git normally shows a chunk of lines that has been modified, not the entire file. Every chunk starts with a Chunk header. The chunk header will be identified by @@ (at the start and end). Then, there are two sets of numbers. For example, if the sets look like -3,4 +3,2, then -3,4 means from old version of code, extracting four lines starting from line 3, and +3,2 means from new version of code, extracting two lines starting from line 3.\n    Then come the modified lines, where the line starting with (-) should be removed from the old code, and the line starting with the (+) should be added to the new code.\n    Here are detailed instructions on how to describe changes in code in git diff format:\n    To specify what needs to be changed in the code, you first need to specify which line of code the changes begin at. You also need to specify how many rows to remove and how many rows to add. This is specified in chunk header format, which looks like this: @@ -START_INDEX,NUM_REMOVED_ROWS +START_INDEX,NUM_ADDED_ROWS @@. In this format, START_INDEX is the number of the line starting from which lines of code must be removed. NUM_REMOVED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be removed from the code starting with line number START_INDEX. And NUM_ADDED_ROWS is the number of lines that must be inserted into the code starting with lines with the number START_INDEX.\n    Here are some examples of how to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines removed and added using the chunk header format.

Accordingly, you need to write only lines with the “-” or “+” sign.\n    Thus, to indicate what changes need to be made to the code, you need to specify the starting line of changes and the number of lines to remove and add in the chunk header format, and also write the lines that need to be removed with a \"-\" sign and the lines that need to be added, with a \"+\" sign.\n You are required to make an additional corridor if you need to connect rooms that are not adjacent.Change the position of the already created rooms so that the rooms do not intersect.\n Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nCode state:\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Flat flat = new Flat(new List<Room> { });\n    return flat;\n}\n```\nCurrent instruction: \"Place the hallway.
