{"input": "Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway. The bathroom should be combined and adjoin the hallway. From the hallway there should be exits to the bedroom and kitchen. From the kitchen there should be an exit to the loggia.", "actions": "1. Place the hallway: The hallway is the first space that should be created as it is the entrance to the apartment. The hallway should be spacious enough to accommodate entrances to other rooms, so make it 1.94 m by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan.\n\n2. Place the combined bathroom: The bathroom should be combined and adjoin the hallway, so make it 1.71 m by 1.49 m. Place it to the right of the hallway in the plan. Make sure to include a bathtub, toilet, and sink in the bathroom design.\n\n3. Design the bedroom: According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 3.2 m by 3.71 m, then its area will be 11.872 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the bathroom in the plan.\n\n4. Add a separate wardrobe: Combine the wardrobe with the hallway for efficient use of space. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.94 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the hallway in the plan and add a door from the hallway.\n\n5. Design the kitchen: According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a rectangular kitchen measuring 2.87 m by 2.87 m. Place the kitchen to the right of the bedroom in the plan. Make a door from the hallway to the kitchen.\n\n6. Add an exit to the loggia: From the kitchen, there should be an exit to the loggia. Place the loggia to the right of the kitchen in the plan, with a door leading from the kitchen to the loggia.\n\nJustification:\n\n* The hallway is placed first, as it is the entrance to the apartment.\n* The combined bathroom is placed next to the hallway for easy access.\n* The bedroom is placed to the right of the bathroom to ensure privacy.\n* The separate wardrobe is combined with the hallway to save space.\n* The kitchen is placed to the right of the bedroom to create a logical flow through the apartment.\n* The loggia is added to provide additional living space and natural light.\n\nThe sequence of actions is designed to optimize the use of space and ensure easy access to all rooms in the apartment. The separate wardrobe is combined with the hallway to save space, and the bathroom is placed next to the hallway for convenience. The bedroom is placed next to the bathroom to ensure privacy, and the kitchen is placed to the right of the bedroom to create a logical flow through the apartment. The loggia is added to provide additional living space and natural light. This sequence of actions meets the requirements of the codes of practice while maximizing the use of space in the apartment.", "code": ["public Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    Room hallway = new Room(name:
