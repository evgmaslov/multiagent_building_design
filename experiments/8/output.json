{"input": "Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway. The bathroom should be combined and adjoin the hallway. From the hallway there should be exits to the bedroom and kitchen. From the kitchen there should be an exit to the loggia.", "actions": "1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be at the top. The hallway should be of moderate size, allowing for easy movement and access to the other rooms. Make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 3 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a shower, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a limited area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the right of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of a bedroom in a one-room apartment should be at least 14 m2. Make a bedroom with dimensions of 3.85 by 3.6 m, then the area will be 13.82 m. Place the bedroom under the bathroom and the hallway in the plan.\n4. Design a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway. The wardrobe should be accessible from the hallway, so make it adjacent to the hallway. Make the wardrobe rectangular with dimensions of 1.61 by 1.85 m. Place the wardrobe next to the bathroom and the hallway in the plan.\n5. Design the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 2.6 by 3.2 m. Place the kitchen below the bedroom and the hallway in the plan. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n6. Add an exit to the loggia from the kitchen. The loggia should be accessible from the kitchen, so make a door between the kitchen and loggia.\n\nThis sequence of actions allows us to create a one-room apartment that meets the requirements of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, while also providing a separate wardrobe and easy access to all rooms. The combined bathroom and separate wardrobe provide functionality without taking up too much space. The loggia provides additional living space and natural light.", "code": "\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    // 1.
