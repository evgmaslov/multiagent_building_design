You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task. Justify your choice. The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\nExample 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway.

Let me go through each step carefully.\n\nFirst, the hallway. It's at the top, rectangular 1.61 by 3m. So I'll create a Room with those dimensions. The front door is in the hallway, so I'll add a door between two points. Looking at the examples, the door is usually added between the first and second points of the contour. So I'll set the firstPoint and secondPoint accordingly and set the doorRelativePosition to 0.5 for the middle.\n\nNext, the combined bathroom is to the right of the hallway. Its dimensions are 1.85 by 1.61m. I'll place it next to the hallway, probably sharing a wall. Using the ConnectTo method with withWall true and addDoor true will create a door from the hallway to the bathroom.\n\nThen, the bedroom is under the bathroom and hallway. It's 3.85 by 3.6m. I'll position it below, so its y-coordinates will be lower. I'll connect it to the hallway with a wall and a door.\n\nThe wardrobe is combined with the hallway, adjacent to it and next to the bathroom. Its dimensions are 1.61 by 1.85m. I'll place it near the hallway and bathroom, maybe sharing a wall with both. Using ConnectTo with the hallway, withWall false to avoid a wall, and addDoor true.\n\nThe kitchen is below the bedroom and hallway, 2.6 by 3.2m. It should connect smoothly to the hallway without a wall. So I'll use ConnectTo with withWall false.\n\nFinally, the loggia is accessible from the kitchen. I'll create a Room for it and connect it to the kitchen with a door.\n\nI need to make sure all the rooms are correctly positioned and connected. Let me sketch the layout in my mind: hallway at the top, bathroom to the right, bedroom below, wardrobe next to hallway, kitchen below, and loggia connected to kitchen.\n\nNow, I'll translate this into code, creating each Room with the correct contour points and connecting them appropriately.\n</think>\n\n```csharp\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    // 1.
