Place the hallway at the entrance of the apartment and make sure to include the front door. The hallway will serve as the main access point to all other rooms.\n\n2. Place the combined kitchen-living room: The combined kitchen-living room must have a total area of more than 25m2. A good size for this room might be 5.4m by 4.7m. This will result in a total area of 25.58m2, which is slightly larger than the minimum requirement. Place this room next to the hallway, making sure to remove any walls between the hallway and the kitchen-living room for easy access.\n\n3. Design the kitchen area: The minimum area for a kitchen in a two-room apartment is 8m2. To meet this requirement, design a kitchen area of 3.2m by 2.5m. This will result in an area of 8m2. Place the kitchen area at one end of the combined kitchen-living room, furthest from the hallway.\n\n4. Include a loggia: The task requires a loggia with an exit from the kitchen. Make the loggia 2m by 1.5m, located next to the kitchen area. This will allow easy access from the kitchen, making it convenient for residents to move between the two spaces.\n\n5. Create the combined bathroom: The minimum size for a combined bathroom is 1.85m by 1.61m. Place the bathroom next to the hallway and include an entrance from the hallway. Design the bathroom with a toilet, sink, and a bathtub or shower.\n\n6. Make a private wardrobe: Next to the bedroom, create a private wardrobe with an area of 2m by 1.5m. This will allow for sufficient storage space for residents and can be accessed only from the bedroom.\n\n7. Design the living room space: The living room should be part of the combined kitchen-living room. It can be the larger part of the combined room, and can be decorated and arranged to suit residents' needs, such as a seating or dining area.\n\n8. Place the bedroom: The bedroom must be accessible from the living room.

Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.4 m by 4.8 m, so that it has an area of approximately 16.32 m2, which satisfies the requirement for a two-person bedroom.\n5. Add a wardrobe: Place a wardrobe along the hallway, near the guest bathroom, to ensure the bedroom remains private. Make the wardrobe rectangular with dimensions of 1.5 m by 3.6 m, so that it has an area of approximately 5.4 m2.\n6. Make a private bathroom: Near the bedroom, make a private bathroom, accessible only from the bedroom. Since it is private, it can be slightly smaller than the guest bathroom.

From the kitchen-living room there should be a corridor to all other rooms. From the corridor there should be access to a combined bathroom and two bedrooms. In one of the bedrooms make a private bathroom.\"", "actions": "1. Design the hallway. The hallway is the first space that residents and guests will encounter when entering the apartment, so it should be functional and spacious. Make the hallway rectangular with dimensions of 1.61 by 3.2 m, providing enough space for movement and storage. Place the hallway at the entrance of the apartment on the plan.\n2. Place the kitchen-living room. The kitchen-living room is the main living space in the apartment, so it should be designed to be comfortable and functional. According to the requirements, the minimum area of the common living room in a three-room apartment is 28 m2, but in this case, the kitchen-living room should be less than 20 m2. Make a rectangular kitchen-living room with dimensions of 3.2 by 6.25 m, providing enough space for a small kitchen area and a seating area. Place the kitchen-living room to the right of the hallway in the plan.\n3. Design a corridor. According to the requirements, a corridor should be provided in 2-, 3- and 4-room apartments for functional connections between rooms. Make a corridor with dimensions of 1.1 by 3.2 m, providing enough space for movement and access to all other rooms. Place the corridor to the right of the kitchen-living room in the plan.\n4. Add a wardrobe. Since the apartment has a small area, a wardrobe adjacent to the hallway will provide extra storage space. Make a rectangular wardrobe with dimensions of 1.2 by 1.6 m, providing enough space for hanging clothes and storage. Place the wardrobe to the left of the hallway in the plan.\n5. Make a combined bathroom. According to the requirements, a combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet, and sink, so the room should have enough space. Make a rectangular bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m, providing enough space for movement and access to all fixtures. Place the bathroom to the right of the corridor in the plan.\n6. Design two bedrooms. According to the requirements, the minimum area of a bedroom should be 8 m2 (10 m2 for two people). Make a rectangular first bedroom with dimensions of 2.5 by 4 m, providing enough space for a double bed and a small seating area. Place the first bedroom at the end of the corridor in the plan. Make a rectangular second bedroom with dimensions of 3.2 by 3.2 m, providing enough space for a double bed, a wardrobe, and a desk. Place the second bedroom to the right of the first bedroom in the plan.\n7. Add a private bathroom. Since one of the bedrooms should have a private bathroom, make it adjacent to the second bedroom. Make a rectangular bathroom with dimensions of 1.4 by 2.5 m, providing enough space for a shower, toilet, and sink. Place the private bathroom to the right of the second bedroom in the plan.\n8.

One of the bedrooms should have an exit to the loggia.\"", "actions": "Based on the given task, here is the sequence of actions that can be taken to design the three-room apartment:\n\n1. Place the hallway: The hallway is the first space that will be placed as it serves as the entrance to the apartment. The hallway should be spacious enough to accommodate a wardrobe, and a connecting corridor to all the other rooms. Let's make the hallway 1.94m by 3.71m.\n2. Add a wardrobe: A wardrobe can be placed next to the hallway to provide storage space for residents. Let's make the wardrobe 1.52m by 1.94m.\n3. Design a connecting corridor: A corridor can be designed to connect all the other rooms from the hallway. The corridor should be wide enough to provide easy access to all the rooms, let's make it 1.2m wide and the length can be adjusted accordingly to fit all the other rooms.\n4. Place the toilet: According to the codes, the area of the toilet should be at least 3m2. Let's make a small rectangular toilet measuring 1.52m by 2.05m. It can be placed near the connecting corridor.\n5. Make a combined bathroom: A combined bathroom can be designed to accommodate a bathtub, toilet, and sink. Let's make the bathroom 2.44m by 2.05m. It can be placed near the connecting corridor.\n6. Design two bedrooms: Two bedrooms should be designed to accommodate two people in each room. According to the codes, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10m2. Let's make the first bedroom 3.2m by 3.71m, and the second bedroom 3.71m by 3.2m. The second bedroom can have an exit to the loggia.\n7. Place the kitchen: The kitchen should be spacious enough to accommodate all the necessary appliances. Let's make the kitchen 3.2m by 2.44m.\n8. Add a living room: A living room can be designed to provide a comfortable space for relaxation and entertainment. The living room should be connected to the kitchen through a door. Let's make the living room 4.43m by 3.71m.\n\nBy following this sequence of actions, the three-room apartment can be designed to meet the requirements of the codes and provide a comfortable living space for the residents. The corridor can connect all the rooms, providing easy access, and the wardrobe next to the hallway can provide storage space. The combined bathroom can accommodate a bathtub, toilet, and sink, and two separate bedrooms can be provided. The kitchen can be designed to accommodate all the necessary appliances, and a living room can be connected to the kitchen to provide a comfortable space for relaxation and entertainment.", "code":

A short corridor should begin in the living room, from which there will be a passage to the guest bathroom and the two remaining bedrooms.\"", "actions": "Based on the input task to design a four-room apartment with the following requirements:\n\n1. The apartment should have three bedrooms, a living room, and a kitchen.\n2. Make a toilet next to the hallway.\n3. From the hallway, there should be an exit to the first bedroom and the living room.\n4. In the first bedroom, make an exit to a private wardrobe, and from the private wardrobe - an exit to a private bathroom.\n5. Make a kitchen next to the living room, remove the wall between the living room and the kitchen.\n6. A short corridor should begin in the living room, from which there will be a passage to the guest bathroom and the two remaining bedrooms.\n\nHere is the sequence of actions to design such an apartment:\n\n1. Design the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so place the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be at the top. The hallway should be spacious enough to accommodate a toilet and provide access to the first bedroom, living room, and guest bathroom. Make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 4 m.\n2. Place the toilet. Since the hallway is spacious, place the toilet at the end of the hallway, making it easily accessible to the residents. Make the toilet rectangular with dimensions of 1.61 by 1.1 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway, at the very end.\n3. Place the first bedroom and living room. According to the requirements of the state codes of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area for a common living room in a four-room apartment is 16 m2. Additionally, each bedroom should have a minimum area of 10 m2 for a two-person bedroom. In order to meet these requirements, make the first bedroom and living room contiguous by designing the living room with dimensions of 3.85 m by 5 m, while the first bedroom has dimensions of 3.2 m by 3.85 m. Place the living room at the bottom of the apartment plan, while the first bedroom is placed to the right of the hallway.\n4. Design a private wardrobe and private bathroom in the first bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2, and the area of the wardrobe and bathroom combined should not exceed 25% of the bedroom area. Make a private wardrobe measuring 1.95 m by 1.49 m, and a private bathroom measuring 1.71 m by 1.49 m. Place the private wardrobe to the right of the first bedroom, and the private bathroom under the wardrobe.\n5. Design the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the kitchen is 8 m2. Design a rectangular kitchen with dimensions of 3.2 m by 2.5 m, and place it to the left of the living room.\n6. Remove the wall between the living room and the kitchen. This will create a spacious common area for cooking, dining, and socializing.\n7. Design the guest bathroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the guest bathroom should be located near the hallway. Make a rectangular guest bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 m by 1.61 m and place it at the top of the apartment plan, to the left of the hallway.\n8. Design the remaining two bedrooms. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Design the remaining two bedrooms with dimensions of 3.2 m by 3.85 m. Place the second bedroom in the middle of the apartment plan, and the third bedroom to the right of the second bedroom.\n9. Design a short corridor in the living room. A short corridor should begin in the living room, from which there will be a passage to the guest bathroom and the two remaining bedrooms. Make the short corridor with dimensions of 1.1 m by 4 m, and place it in the plan under the living room and the kitchen.\n\nThese steps will help you design a four-room apartment with the required rooms, while meeting the requirements of the state codes of rules for the design of residential buildings.", "code": ["\npublic Flat DesignFlat()\n{\n    // Define the rooms\n    Room hallway = new

The corridor should be long and spacious to provide comfortable access to the bedrooms, guest bathroom, and kitchen-living room. Make the corridor rectangular with dimensions of 1.8 m by 10 m, with an L-shaped path connecting the bedrooms and other rooms.\n\n4. Design the first bedroom: The first bedroom should have an exit to the loggia. Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.5 m by 4.0 m, and place it near the L-shaped corridor, with direct access to the corridor. Add a door to the loggia as well.\n\n5. Design the second bedroom: The second bedroom should have a regular rectangular shape. Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.5 m by 4.0 m, and place it on the opposite side of the apartment plan from the first bedroom, also with direct access to the L-shaped corridor. Add a door to the room.\n\n6. Design the third bedroom: The third bedroom should have access to an additional private wardrobe and a private bathroom. Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.5 m by 4.0 m, and place it in a location that allows for the addition of the private wardrobe and bathroom. Remove walls between the bedroom and the private wardrobe and bathroom.\n\n7. Create the private wardrobe: In the third bedroom, make an additional private wardrobe with dimensions of 1.5 m by 2.5 m, and place it in a corner of the bedroom.\n\n8. Design the private bathroom: In the third bedroom, make a private bathroom with dimensions of 2.0 m by 2.0 m, and place it next to the private wardrobe. The private bathroom should have a sink, toilet, and a shower or bathtub, depending on the desired amenities.\n\n9. Design the guest bathroom: Finally, add a guest bathroom that can be accessed from the L-shaped corridor. Make the guest bathroom rectangular with dimensions of 2.0 m by 1.5 m, and place it in a location that requires minimal rearrangement of the L-shaped corridor. The guest bathroom should also have a sink and toilet, with a shower as an optional amenity.\n\nOnce all the rooms have been designed according to these steps, double-check that all dimensions and connections meet the required specifications and codes.
