You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a studio apartment.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a studio apartment with a large kitchen area of \\u200b\\u200bat least 6 m2.

Design the hallway. The hallway should be spacious and welcoming, as it is the first space that residents and guests will see upon entering the apartment. Given the requirement for a large hallway, make it at least 3.2 m by 1.9 m, providing enough space for movement and furnishings. Place the hallway at the entrance of the apartment, with the front door located at the beginning of the hallway.\n\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should be functional and efficient, containing a shower, toilet, and sink. The bathroom should be adjacent to the hallway for easy access. Considering the requirement for a large kitchen, place the bathroom at the far end of the hallway, making it rectangular with dimensions of 1.9 m by 1.6 m. This will allow for a larger kitchen area while still providing adequate space for the bathroom.\n\n3. Design the studio apartment space. With the hallway and combined bathroom placed, the remaining space will be used for the studio apartment's open-concept living, dining, and kitchen area. Given the requirement for a large kitchen area of at least 6 m2, the living room and dining areas will be combined with the kitchen, creating a spacious and cohesive environment. Divide the remaining area into three sections:\n\n   a. Kitchen: Allocate a space of 3.2 m by 2 m for the kitchen. This area meets the 6 m2 requirement and provides enough space for essential appliances, countertops, and storage.\n\n   b. Living Room: The living room area should be adjacent to the kitchen, forming a cohesive open-concept space. Allocate a space of 3.2 m by 2.5 m for the living room, which will provide ample room for seating and relaxation.\n\n   c. Dining Area: Place the dining area between the kitchen and living room, ensuring easy access to both spaces. Allocate a space of 2.5 m by 1.9 m for the dining area, which can accommodate a table and chairs for four people.\n\nBy following this sequence of actions, you will create a studio apartment that meets the given requirements, providing a functional, spacious, and inviting living environment."}, {"model_name": "mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1", "system_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a qualified CAD engineer.You can create drawings in a CAD system.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a one-room apartment, more than 30 m2.

The hallway is a necessary part of the apartment, it should be at the entrance to the apartment. The hallway can be rectangular, with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 x 2 m.\n3. Place the combined bathroom. Since the bathroom is combined, it should be located together with the kitchen. The bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. I will make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 2.1 x 2.05 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway.\n4. Design the kitchen-bedroom area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, I will make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 x 4.24 m, then the area will be 22.8 m2.\n5. Place the entrance to the bedroom. The entrance to the bedroom should be located in the common room area. The bedroom should have an area of at least 10 m2 (taking into account the requirements for a one-room apartment), so I will make a bedroom with dimensions of 3.2 x 3.43 m, then the area will be 11 m2.\n\nThe resulting apartment layout meets the requirements of the task. The hallway has access to the combined bathroom and kitchen, and the entrance to the bedroom is from the kitchen area. The area of the apartment is more than 30 m2, and the area of the common living room is 22.8 m2."}, {"model_name": "mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1", "system_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a qualified CAD engineer.You can create drawings in a CAD system.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a two-room apartment with a large combined kitchen-living room with a total area of \\u200b\\u200bmore than 25 m2.

Place the combined kitchen-living room: The combined kitchen-living room must have a total area of more than 25m2. A good size for this room might be 5.4m by 4.7m. This will result in a total area of 25.58m2, which is slightly larger than the minimum requirement. Place this room next to the hallway, making sure to remove any walls between the hallway and the kitchen-living room for easy access.\n\n3. Design the kitchen area: The minimum area for a kitchen in a two-room apartment is 8m2. To meet this requirement, design a kitchen area of 3.2m by 2.5m. This will result in an area of 8m2. Place the kitchen area at one end of the combined kitchen-living room, furthest from the hallway.\n\n4. Include a loggia: The task requires a loggia with an exit from the kitchen. Make the loggia 2m by 1.5m, located next to the kitchen area. This will allow easy access from the kitchen, making it convenient for residents to move between the two spaces.\n\n5. Create the combined bathroom: The minimum size for a combined bathroom is 1.85m by 1.61m. Place the bathroom next to the hallway and include an entrance from the hallway. Design the bathroom with a toilet, sink, and a bathtub or shower.\n\n6. Make a private wardrobe: Next to the bedroom, create a private wardrobe with an area of 2m by 1.5m. This will allow for sufficient storage space for residents and can be accessed only from the bedroom.\n\n7. Design the living room space: The living room should be part of the combined kitchen-living room. It can be the larger part of the combined room, and can be decorated and arranged to suit residents' needs, such as a seating or dining area.\n\n8. Place the bedroom: The bedroom must be accessible from the living room. A reasonable size for the bedroom might be 3.7m by 3.2m, providing enough space for a bed and additional furniture.\n\nIn following these steps, the design of the two-room apartment will meet the requirements of the task while adhering to the standards for social housing.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Make a two-room apartment with a large combined kitchen-living room, with an area of \\u200b\\u200bat least 25 m2.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Make a two-room apartment with a large combined kitchen-living room, with an area of \\u200b\\u200bat least 25 m2.

Given the requirement, the hallway should have an area of at least 25 m2 (taking into account the size of the kitchen-living room). The hallway should be located at the entrance of the apartment. Make the hallway rectangular with dimensions of 5.2 m by 4.8 m, so that it meets the area requirement and provides sufficient space for movement and placement of doors.\n2. Place the kitchen-living room: According to the codes, the minimum area of a common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2. To accommodate the requirement of having a large combined kitchen-living room with an area of at least 25 m2, make the kitchen-living room rectangular with dimensions of 5.2 m by 4.8 m. Place it next to the hallway, with a smooth transition (e.g., without a wall between them) to make it more spacious.\n3. Make a strict guest bathroom: Place the guest bathroom in the hallway as it should have an entrance from the hallway. Given the requirement, make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions of 1.5 m by 2.4 m, and make sure there is enough space for a toilet, sink, and shower.\n4. Place the bedroom: Since the apartment should have a strict guest bathroom along the hallway, place the bedroom next to it, with the remaining space in the hallway serving as a connection between the rooms. Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.4 m by 4.8 m, so that it has an area of approximately 16.32 m2, which satisfies the requirement for a two-person bedroom.\n5. Add a wardrobe: Place a wardrobe along the hallway, near the guest bathroom, to ensure the bedroom remains private. Make the wardrobe rectangular with dimensions of 1.5 m by 3.6 m, so that it has an area of approximately 5.4 m2.\n6. Make a private bathroom: Near the bedroom, make a private bathroom, accessible only from the bedroom. Since it is private, it can be slightly smaller than the guest bathroom. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.5 m by 1.6 m, and make sure there is enough space for a toilet, sink, and a shower or bathtub.\n\nThis sequence of actions will result in a well-planned two-room apartment that meets all the requirements provided in the task, with a large combined kitchen-living room, a long hallway, and private bedroom and bathroom areas."}, {"model_name": "mistralai/Codestral-22B-v0.1", "system_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "You are a qualified CAD engineer.You can create drawings in a CAD system.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Make a three-room apartment with two bathrooms, one of which will be combined.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway.

Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Design a four-room apartment.

You receive an input task to create an apartment. Describe in detail the sequence of actions that need to be done to design an apartment according to the task.Justify your choice.\n The sequence of actions should include only the creation of rooms. Here are some examples of what you need to do:\n    Example 1\nTask to create an apartment: Design a studio apartment. Let there be a small hallway, next to which there will be a combined bathroom. From the hallway there will be an exit to the main space of the apartment, where the kitchen area and the living room area will be located.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should be at the entrance to the apartment, so put the front door in the hallway. On the apartment plan, the hallway should be on top. The hallway should be small, but have enough space for changing clothes, so make the hallway rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 1.61 by 2 m.\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The combined bathroom should have a bathtub, toilet and sink, so the room should have enough space. At the same time, the bathroom should be compact, since the designed apartment has a small area. Make a combined bathroom with dimensions of 1.85 by 1.61 m and place it in the plan to the left of the hallway. Be sure to make a door from the hallway to the bathroom so that residents can get there.\n3. Design the living room and kitchen area. According to the requirement of the state code of rules for the design of residential buildings, the minimum area of ​​a common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. In order for our apartment to meet this requirement, make a common room with dimensions of 5.39 m by 3.85 m, then the area will be equal to 20.75 m.\nExample 2\nTask to create an apartment: Design a one-room apartment with a kitchen-living room, with an area of at least 17 m2. The apartment should have a separate bedroom with its own wardrobe, which can only be accessed from the bedroom. Make a combined bathroom with an exit from the hallway. Also make a separate wardrobe in the hallway and an exit to the kitchen-living room. The entrance to the bedroom should be from the kitchen-living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Design the hallway. Make a hallway with a separate cloakroom area. The cloakroom area should be 1.2 m by 2.75 m, while the remaining hallway area should be 1.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the hallway with a cloakroom at the top of the apartment plan.\n2. Place the bathroom. The bathroom should be combined and have enough space for a bathtub, toilet and sink. Make the bathroom rectangular with dimensions in the plan of 2.1 m by 2.05 m. Place the bathroom at the top of the apartment plan to the right of the hallway.\n3. Design a kitchen-living room. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the minimum area of the common living room in a one-room apartment is 14 m2. Therefore, make a kitchen-living room measuring 3.2 m by 5.4 m, then its area will be 17.28 m. Place the kitchen-living room next to the hallway, on the apartment plan it should be located under the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the living room - there should be no wall between them.\n4. Design a bedroom. According to the requirements of the codes of practice, the area of a bedroom for two people should be at least 10 m2. Since the apartment has one bedroom, two people will sleep in it at once, so the area of the bedroom in the apartment should be at least 10 m2. Make a bedroom measuring 4.7 m by 3.2 m, while \"cutting off\" the corner of the bedroom to make room for a private wardrobe.\n5. Add a private wardrobe. In the corner \"cut off\" from the bedroom, place a small private wardrobe, measuring 1.95 m by 2 m.\nExample 3\nTask to create an apartment: Design a two-room apartment with a kitchen-living room. Make two wardrobes, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the bedroom. Make two bathrooms, one of which is a guest one, with an entrance from the hallway, and the other is private, with an entrance from the private wardrobe. Make the entrance to the bedroom from the living room.\nSequence of actions: 1. Place the hallway. The hallway should accommodate the entrances to the wardrobe, toilet, and kitchen, so make it 1.94 by 2.87 m. Place the hallway in the lower left corner of the apartment plan. Don't forget to add the entrance to the apartment.\n2. Add a guest wardrobe. The guest wardrobe should be located next to the hallway, and there should be space left for the guest toilet. Make a wardrobe measuring 1.52 m by 3.71 m. Place the guest wardrobe to the right of the hallway. Add a door between the wardrobe and the hallway.\n3. Make a guest toilet. The entrance to the guest toilet should be from the hallway, so the toilet should be next to the hallway. Make a guest toilet measuring 1.35 m by 3.71 m. Place the toilet to the right of the hallway in the plan, it should be above the guest wardrobe. Make a door from the hallway to the toilet.\n4. Place the kitchen. According to the requirements of the codes, the area of the kitchen should be at least 8 m2. Make a long rectangular kitchen measuring 4.43 by 1.94 m. Place the kitchen immediately after the hallway, in the plan the kitchen should be above the hallway. Make a smooth transition from the hallway to the kitchen, remove the wall between them.\n5. Add a living room. The living room should form a single space with the kitchen, so place the living room to the right of the kitchen and remove the wall between them. The living room should be located above the guest toilet in the plan. According to the requirements of the codes, the minimum area of the common living room in a two-room apartment is 16 m2, so make the living room rectangular in plan with dimensions of 4.43 m by 3.71 m.\n6. Design a bedroom for two people. According to the requirements of regulatory documents, the area of a bedroom for two people should be more than 10 m2. Make a rectangular bedroom measuring 4.43 m by 3.2 m, then its area will be 14.176 m2. Place the bedroom to the right of the living room in the plan. Make a door from the living room to the bedroom.\n7. Add a private wardrobe. Next to the bedroom, make a private wardrobe, measuring 2.87 m by 1.49 m. Place it below the bedroom in the plan and add a door from the bedroom.\n8. Make a private bathroom. The private bathroom must be combined, because the apartment must have at least one bathtub. The combined bathroom must have enough area to accommodate a bathtub, toilet and sink. The bathroom should be located between the guest bathroom and the private wardrobe in the plan, so it can be a maximum of 1.71 m wide. Make it rectangular with dimensions of 1.71 m by 2.87 m and make an entrance to it from the wardrobe through a door."}], "user_prompt": [{"type": "text", "text": "\"Make a four-room apartment with a kitchen-living room and three bedrooms.
