    "input": "Make a one-room apartment with a separate wardrobe combined with the hallway. The bathroom should be combined and adjoin the hallway. From the hallway there should be exits to the bedroom and kitchen. From the kitchen there should be an exit to the loggia.",
    "actions": "1. Design the hallway. Since the hallway is combined with a wardrobe, it should be large enough to accommodate both a wardrobe and a bathroom entrance. A recommended size for the hallway would be 1.61m by 3.6m, which provides enough space for a wardrobe and a smooth transition to other rooms. Place the hallway at the entrance of the apartment.\n\n2. Place the combined bathroom. The bathroom should have enough space for a shower, toilet, and sink. A suitable size would be 1.85m by 1.61m, making it rectangular and placing it to the left of the hallway. Ensure there is a door from the hallway to the bathroom.\n\n3. Design the kitchen. The minimum area for a kitchen in a one-room apartment is 8m2. Make the kitchen rectangular with dimensions of 2.8m by 2.87m, which results in an area of 8m2. Place the kitchen next to the hallway, with a smooth transition to the living room.\n\n4. Add a separate wardrobe in the hallway. A suitable size for the wardrobe would be 1.61m by 2m. Place it in the hallway, ensuring enough space for the hallway, bathroom entrance, and wardrobe.\n\n5. Design the bedroom. The minimum area for a bedroom for two people is 10m2. Make the bedroom rectangular with dimensions of 3.2m by 3.2m, ensuring a comfortable space for two people. Place the bedroom next to the kitchen.\n\n6. Add a door from the kitchen to the loggia. The loggia should be accessible from the kitchen for convenient access to outdoor space. Make sure to place a door between the kitchen and the loggia.\n\nIn summary, the apartment will have a hallway with a combined bathroom and a separate wardrobe, a kitchen leading to the loggia, and a separate bedroom. Each room has enough space for its intended purpose and adheres to the recommended sizes for a one-room apartment.",
